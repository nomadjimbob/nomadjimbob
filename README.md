Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm James

I am a developer currently working on some cool things in the STEM space over at <a href="https://github.com/stemmechanics">STEMMechanics</a> and in my spare time, I work on <a href="https://github.com/drustcraft">Drustcraft</a>, a Minecraft role playing engine and server!
